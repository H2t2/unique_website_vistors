# unique_website_vistors
My project to identify unique visitors to my portfolio site

My goal for this project is see how frequently my portfolio website is looked at. I hope to use the total count as a barometer for how much interest there is in the work I do.


## The IP is the Key
Simply, I could count the number of hits to my website. I'd like to develop more advanced and accurate metrics, that better fit unique. An IP Address should be a good start. This one metric would be enough for a proof of concept, since collecting that already gives the project depth.

I will need to:
- build a basic web-app that is connected to my portfolio
- review network data between a visiting browser and server
- build a system or database to handle and record the data
- research privacy laws and how collecting PII is handled


## Get Er Done
I plan to build this project with Node.js and focus on working with javascript. This will likely mean Express for the web server, possibly apache, and SQL for the Database.

Along with the application, I'll have to look in at the operations side. AWS will likely be the first home of my application (since I have experience with it).

I will be utilizing this project as my first step back into programming and software development. Which means I'll be refreshing a lot of git, Node.js, JavaScript, network and generally software engineering knowledge. There will be some turbulence.

Hopefully there will be detailed logging that shows the growth of my skills.

## Future Goals:
- capture more data
- write code in python
- quantify revisits
